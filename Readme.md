# 4d-widgets

4D widgets are functionalities provided as components that can be accessed from the Form editor and/or the preconfigured object library. These widgets are compound objects with predefined characteristics. They provide access to standard functions and are very simple to implement.

Three widgets are available:
* SearchPicker: search area with standard appearance.
* DatePicker: date selector.
* TimePicker: time selector.

For more detail, read the [4D Widgets documentation](https://doc.4d.com/4Dv18/4D/18/4D-Widgets.100-4690706.en.html)
